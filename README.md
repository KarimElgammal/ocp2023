# OCP2023 challenge
Here comes our proposed solution to the OC23 challenge

- A good first step is to make adsorbML work with OCP darasets, for those details see [here](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/main/INSTALL.md) to install OCP and the docker image details in [here](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/tutorial/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile) to install adsorbML with OCP.

- You can find excellent example scripts in the OCP team tutorial for adsorbML and OCP [here](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/tutorial/tree/main)
